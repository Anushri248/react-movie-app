# 🎬 Movie Cards UI – React Mini Project

This is a React.js mini project built as part of my learning journey. The project displays a list of movies (2001–2010) with dynamic styling and interactive UI.

## 🚀 What I Learned

🔹 **JSX and Component Structure**  
– Used both functional components and custom reusable components.

🔹 **Props Handling**  
– Sent props from **parent to child** and even handled **data from child to parent**.

🔹 **Working with JSON**  
– Managed external JSON data for movies and passed it using props.

🔹 **JSX Loops & Dynamic Rendering**  
– Used `.map()` to loop through the movie list and dynamically render cards.

🔹 **Conditional Styling**  
– Applied dynamic CSS styles (like color changes) based on movie rating.

🔹 **Inline and External CSS**  
– Mixed both inline styles and external CSS files for cleaner UI.

🔹 **Responsive Layouts**  
– Built responsive UI using CSS flexbox and grid concepts.
